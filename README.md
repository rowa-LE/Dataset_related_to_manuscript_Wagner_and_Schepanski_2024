# Dataset_related_to_manuscript_Wagner_and_Schepanski_2024

This dataset belongs to the manuscript of Wagner and Schepanski (2024) entitled "Quantifying fire-driven dust emissions using a global aerosol model" submitted to the "Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES)".

It contains the for the 10 year simulation period 2004-2013 the monthly, seasonal, or yearly averaged fields of the variables (variable name in brackets) that were used to prepare the plots and statements made in the manuscript. These are in detail:
1) GFAS input data about FRP (frp)
2) simulated AOD (tau_2d_550nm) and dust AOD (tau_comp_du_550nm)
3) simulated wind-driven (emi_du_dust) and fire-driven (emi_du_fdust) dust emission fluxes
4) simulated atmospheric dust concentration (du_all) including the soluble/insoluble coarse (du_ci, du_cs) and accumulation (du_ai, du_as) mode together with vertical atmospheric pressure levels (pfull)

The simulated results are provided for both simulations, the **control run** without the additional fire-dust emissions and the actual **firedust simulation** with the new fire-dust emission parameterization.
